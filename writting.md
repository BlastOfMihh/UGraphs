# : I do yava script


Small bro: But how am I going to afford going to Bucharest

Big bro with a **smirk*** on his face: That's not for you to worry because I!... I;ve learnt javascript. I know angular and react and I have a couple of personal projects. I can support you financially. Programmers are payed too much for the work they do anyway.
